select * from get_random_songs_from_playlist(48); -> playlist_id = 48
=> check to see whether it return any row
    + If has error: Could not choose a best candidate function. You might need to add explicit type casts => in DB has functions with the same name (in this case is: get_random_songs_from_playlist(...))
    => run this in supabase sql to return all functions with the same name:
SELECT
    proname AS function_name,
    pg_get_function_identity_arguments(p.oid) AS arguments,
    pg_get_function_result(p.oid) AS return_type,
    n.nspname AS schema_name
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE proname = 'get_random_songs_from_playlist';

    => for clean, delete all function and create the new one
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_random_songs_from_playlist(integer);
...

After that, run this query again: select * from get_random_songs_from_playlist(48); -> playlist_id = 48
